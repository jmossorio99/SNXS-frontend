            </div>

                <p>SNXS is a web application that attempts to make it easier for users to find vulnerabilities in their
                    web products by using open-source backend tools but with a much more user-friendly frontend look and
                    feel.</p>
                <p>SNXS was developed after noticing that most tools to detect SQL, NoSQL injections and XSS fell into
                    two groups:</p>
                <div className={classes.featureList}>
                        <p><em>1.</em> User-friendly but expensive</p>
                        <p><em>2.</em> Free but difficult to use</p>
                </div>
                <p>The app was part of a graduation project at Icesi University in 2021
                    and the goal is to set the basis for what could become the best open-source tool for scanning
                    websites. Those involved are:</p>
                <ul className={classes.list}>

                </ul>
                <p>The following tools are used by SNXS to scan for each of the vulnerabilities:</p>
