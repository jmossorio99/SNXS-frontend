                <p>SNXS is a web application that attempts to make it easier for users to find vulnerabilities in their
                    web products by using open-source backend tools but with a much more user-friendly frontend look and
                    feel.</p>
                <p>SNXS was developed after noticing that most tools to detect SQL, NoSQL injections and XSS fell into
                    two groups:</p>
                <div className={classes.featureList}>
                        <p><img className={classes.numberImage} src={NumberOne} alt="number 1"/> User-friendly but expensive</p>
                        <p><img className={classes.numberImage} src={NumberTwo} alt="number 2"/> Free but difficult to use</p>
                </div>
                <p>The app was started as a thesis project by Jose Ossorio and Marco PÃ©rez at Icesi University on 2021
                    and our goal is to set the basis for what could become the best open-source tool for scanning
                    websites.</p>
